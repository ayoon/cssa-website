                        <p>Salutations! My name is Michelle and I’m so excited to be your president this year. I’m a graduating senior in Cognitive Science major. First and foremost, I love to make puns and jokes, like really REALLY bad ones. In addition to exploring the infinite mysteries of the mind, I am also interested in the field of public health, specifically in mental health services. I’ve also had experience researching in labs at Cal. I’ve worked in the Sleep and Cognition Lab under Matt Walker working on data analysis and running experiments (mainly with EEG) to look at the effect that sleep has on cognitive performance and emotion. I’ve also worked in the Jacobs Lab in which we look at the economics of squirrel caching behaviors. If you want to talk about time and balance management or just about anything else, feel free to shoot me an email. Look forward to meeting you!</p>

                        <p>Hello! As the external vice president of CSSA, I am a fourth year cognitive science major and am also participating in a concentration program at the Center for Entrepreneurship and Technology. What appeals to me most about cognitive science is its application to education and technology, how we can use what we know about cognition and learning to enhance the tools we use to teach, to learn and to collaborate. I hope to indulge in the field of education technology and social media after college so as to enhance education through the wonderful wizard that is the brain. Aside from academia, I like to explore my epicurean spirit and cook or go out to cool and unique restaurants with my friends. And if I'm not in the kitchen or slaving away on a programming assignment, you'll probably find me in SF at a cool venue for a local show. Music, brains and food forever <3</p>

                        <p>Hey guys, I'm Sohee. I'm a third year student majoring in Cognitive Science with a smidgen of Molecular and Cell Bio. I joined CSSA in the second semester of my freshmen year, and CSSA has been a wonderful part of my college life ever since. We got some awesome chill people and extraordinary passion for food ;) I'm definitely enjoying the interdisciplinary nature of CogSci, but my passion is neuroscience and its approaches to our mind. I'm currently working at the Whitney Lab, working with fMRI data for vision studies. Outside of CSSA, I like to sleep, draw, and travel. Don't hesitate to ask me about cognitive science, pre-med, MCB, life... anything! I look forward to another amazing year and can't wait to drag more people into the wonderful world of cognitive science!</p>

                        <p>Hi all, I’m Bridget! I was a bit late to jump on the Cogsci boat, but am so glad I did. Cogsci has exposed me to a variety of amazing teachers and classes here at Berkeley, and joining CSSA has been a great way to meet fellow students with many talents and interests, brain related and beyond. I’m really looking forward to being your marketing director for the year, and ultimately hope to have a simply smashing conference in the spring (and, of course, many cool events along the way). Outside of school, I work in cognitive development research, co-facilitate the BROCA DeCal, and every other week, drive back to Davis to help with the UCD Surgical Internship. I love animals, music, taking & editing photos, and riding my bike in the early evening. Feel free to shoot me an email (bvmacdonald at berkeley dot edu) or talk to me at our next meeting – look forward to meeting you!</p>

                        <p>Hello! This year I will continue as the Outreach Coordinator of the CSSA, meaning I will be working on Cognitive Science related events in the community of and around UC Berkeley. This spans from Neuroscience lessons at local elementary schools to participating in the Bay Area Science Festival in San Francisco. My niche of Cognitive Science is creativity. As a double Cognitive Science and Practice of Art major, I find the creative human mind fascinating. Additionally, I am interested in the intersection between art and science. You can usually find me with a brain or paintbrush in hand, otherwise I love to explore the bay area, vibe with some great tunes, and meet new people.</p>

I haven’t decided what I want to do after I graduate, but I’ve always been fascinated by the way people think and interact, and I love the way that CogSci brings together so many different disciplines and allows you to study the mind from many perspectives. CSSA was the first club I joined at Berkeley, and I’ve been Treasurer since December of 2012. Outside of CSSA, I’m involved in ResLife in the residence halls and tutor for OASES. I love music (I played harp and handbells in high school), learning new languages (though I’m not very good at it), and before I graduate, I plan to study abroad. I’m excited to continue to be a part of the organization that makes such wonderful CogSci-related programs and socials possible, and I hope to see you at our meetings!</p>

In case you are confused by my officer title, I basically manage all of the technical matters of CSSA, from updating the website to finding ways to improve our club operations through incorporating technology.

I'm also co-facilitating the Berkeley Review of CogSci Articles (BROCA) DeCal. We have a great line up of speakers this semester so come check us out! Outside of the CSSA, I work for the BearWALK program (and currently working on being able to walk actual bears), have a red belt in American Tang Soo Do, and am completely obsessed with dogs.</p>

I am also on the pre-med track in hopes of becoming a neurologist or a neurosurgeon and would love to do more hardcore research on Alzheimer's disease. I have been in CSSA for about three years now and had the privilege of meeting wonderful peers who share similar interest, drive and goals. Besides CSSA, I like to go on hikes -- eh, more like strolls, I guess. I like to read and converse (I can be pretty friendly). Come out and join us for the awesome year ahead!</p>
